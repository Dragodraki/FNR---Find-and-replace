-------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS TECHNICALLY
-------------------------------
The tool is written in C#, a standard WinForm application is used. ZZZProjects put very much effort into the technique of filtering and data processing. All you need to do is enter the folder path to your target file(s), the file name and the mask (what you look for and what it should be replaced with). I am not very familiar with the detailed work of regex and complicated binary comparisons, but these are available too. The GUI even offers a button for generating the whole options as one single command-line.
Thats one of the funniest things: Tools having a GUI but a (silent) command-line interface at the same time, need a WinForm. When entering parameter/command-line options, the WinForm will be started too, but immediately hidden so the user does not even notice. This way, there isn't any black console window blinking for a seccond and then disappear, but completely invisible. A normal double-clicking on the executable instead will open the GUI.

-------------------------------
VERSION 1.8.1 -> 1.9.0 (fork)
-------------------------------

Optical:
- Added: HighDpiAware - Means clearer outlines of font and shape.
- Added: Icon with the official ZZZProjects image
- Added: To avoid truncated elements, the app is launched maximized on old OS
- Changed: The app elements in the FormDesigner have all been rearranged
- Changed: Donate image removed + logo is presented more favorably
- Changed: Assembly information has been slightly adjusted

Functional:
- Full compatibility with Windows XP!!!
(instead of .NET Framework 4.5 now only .NET Framework 4.0 is required) - the error was that after compiling in VisualStudio the packer "ILMerge" took a higher framework as a new requirement, I used ILMerge on Windows XP and thus used its lower
and thus set its lower requirement as a benchmark
- After execution via command line, the (invisible) app and thus the process is closed properly (entering ENTER in a visible terminal is no longer terminal to exit is no longer necessary), this was a very big bug in the original version of ZZZProjects

USAGE
-------------------------------
You can use the GUI mode by open with no parameter or the command-line interface like cmd, powershell, any other console or an automated call from script/program for automatic (batch) processing.

Syntax usage:  
- fnr.exe [-Parameter]<br/>

Parameters:  
--cl 	  Required to run on command line.<br/>
--find 	  Required. Text to find.<br/>
--replace 	  Replacement text. If not specified only find operation is performed.<br/>
--useRegEx 	  Use regular expressions in ‘find’ parameter.<br/>
--useEscapeChars 	  Use escape chars like ‘\n’ in ‘find’ and ‘replace’ parameters.<br/>
--caseSensitive 	  Case Sensitive.<br/>
--dir 	  Required. Directory path.<br/>
--includeSubDirectories 	  Include files in SubDirectories.<br/>
--fileMask 	  Required. File mask or multiple file masks separated by comma.<br/>
--excludeFileMask 	  File masks to exclude. If multiple - separate by comma<br/>
--help 	  Dispaly help screen.<br/>
--showEncoding 	  Displays detected encoding for each file with matches.<br/>
--silent 	  Supress the command window output.<br/>
--logFile 	  Path to log file where to save command output.<br/>
--skipBinaryFileDetection 	  Ignore detection of binary files.<br/>
--alwaysUseEncoding 	  Skip encoding detection and always use specified encoding.<br/>
--defaultEncodingIfNotDetected 	  If encoding is not detected in some very rare cases, use this one.<br/>
--includeFilesWithoutMatches   	Include files without matches in results.<br/>
--setErrorLevelIfAnyFileErrors 	  Return ErrorLevel 2 if any files have read/write errors.<br/>

Examples:  
- fnr.exe --cl --dir "C:\temp\myfolder" --fileMask "myfile.txt" --find "StringToSearch=123" --replace "StringToReplace=888"
This will target "C:\temp\myfolder\myfile.txt" only and replace the string "StringToSearch=123" with "StringToReplace=888" (both without quotation marks of course).<br/>
